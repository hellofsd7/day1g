Diifernece between http1 and http2 ("Hypertext Transfer Protocol")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HTTP1:
------
*HTTP1 is a top-level application protocol that exchanges information between a client computer and a local or remote web server. 

*In this process, a client sends a text-based request to a server by calling a method like GET or POST. 

*In response, the server sends a resource like an HTML page back to the client.

*HTTP1 was usually using the Transmission Control Protocol, or TCP) and networking layers (using the Internet Protocol, or IP):

*HTTP1 transfers these in plain-text messages.

*The amount of data to be loaded on a single page increased.

*In HTTP1, The flow control relies on the underlying TCP connection.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HTTP2:
------
*HTTP2 had invented for reducing web page load latency by using techniques such as compression, multiplexing, and prioritization.

*It supported standardization effort, including Chrome, Opera, Internet Explorer, and Safari.

*Its encodes these into binary, allowing for significantly different delivery model possibilities.

*HTTP2 is always clear and loading faster.

*In HTTP2, The binary framing layer encodes requests/responses and cuts them up into smaller packets of information, greatly increasing the flexibility of data transfer.

*HTTP2 multiplexes streams of data within a single TCP connection.
