"Objects And Its Internal Representation In JavaScript"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*In Java script, Objects is the most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. 

*Objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. 

*These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.

*For Eg. If your object is a student, it will have properties like name, age, address, id, etc and methods like updateAddress, updateNam, etc.

*A JavaScript object has properties associated with it. A property of an object can be explained as a variable that is attached to the object. 

*For Eg. objectName.propertyName

*Create JavaScript Object with Object Literal===>>>One of easiest way to create a javascript object is object literal, simply define the property and values inside curly braces.

*For Eg.===>>>let bike = {name: 'SuperSport', maker:'Ducati', engine:'937cc'};

*Create JavaScript Object with ConstructorCreate JavaScript Object with Constructor.

*Constructor is nothing but a function and with help of new keyword, constructor function allows to create multiple objects of same flavor.

*For Eg 
function Vehicle(name, maker) {
   this.name = Dhiyanesh;
   this.maker = Kannan;
}
let car1 = new Vehicle('Dhiyanesh', 'Tata');
let car2 = new Vehicle('Kannan', 'BMW')
console.log(car1.name);    //Output: Dhiyanesh
console.log(car2.name);    //Output: Kannan

*In JS, using the Object.create method.

*Objects can also be created using the Object.create() method. This method can be very useful, 
  because it allows you to choose the prototype object for the object you want to create,
  without having to define a constructor function.
